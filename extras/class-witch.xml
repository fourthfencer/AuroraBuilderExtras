		<description>
			<p>Three old crones stoop over a boiling cauldron filled with all manner of bizarre filth, churning and bubbling with a noxious fume. In the smoke and vapor above the pot, the trio can make out shapes and figures of great import, and one even cackles loudly at what she sees.</p>
			<p class="indent">A young girl sits underneath a tree, far from where the other children play. She glances about to make sure noone is watching, and snaps her fingers once to the empty air. After a moment of silence, a black cat appears around the tree's bend and locks eyes with the girl, staring with a strange intelligence for a long moment. She gestures at one of the playing children, a heavy-set boy with a permanently affixed scowl; the cat understands. It wanders close to the boy, stretches its claws, and gets very low, ready to pounce for the boy's eyes.</p>
			<p class="indent">A young elf intently mutters something underneath his breath each time he exhales. Visible only to him, a string of the foulest magic winds out from him and seizes a charging orc, which drops to its knees in agony.</p>
			<p class="indent">Witches are stricken by magic so dark it imprints a lasting shadow upon their essence. Through force of personality alone, they can spin this darkness outward, hexing creatures, casting manipulative spells, and even commanding a familiar with their thoughts.</p>
			<h4>CURSED</h4>
			<p>While others are blessed with magic, witches are cursed by it. Afflicted by some hateful arcana, whether accidentally or intentionally, witches are twisted inside and out by its daily tortures. With gruesome effort, they can warp this power into spells to wrack others with the same torture which plagues them.</p>
			<h4>PARIAHS AND OUTCASTS</h4>
			<p>Almost without exception, witches are feared and hated. They are victim to a number of misconceptions about them, usually relating them to hags and other evil creatures of the night which prey on innocent people. As a result, known witches are in great personal danger and can usually be found dwelling on the outskirts of civilization where townsfolk seldom tread. This does little to stop witch hunting and burnings, but provides some measure of safety from them.</p>
			<p class="indent">In reality, very few choose to become witches, and many of them can hide adeptly in society, using their magic to fill a number of roles, from seer to healer to apothecary. Being accused as a witch carries grave consequences, no matter the validity of the claim, so wise witches move frequently, never residing in one place for too long.</p>
			<h4>FAMILIAR MASTERS</h4>
			<p>It is rare to find a witch without his or her constant companion, the familiar. Though familiars might be conjured by other spellcasters as well, a witch's familiar with good reason is ubiquitous to common folk. Witches command intuitive magic, and have a deep link to their familiars. As a result, they can conjure more exotic familiars, and command them more swiftly than other spellcasters.</p>
			<h4>CREATING A WITCH </h4>
			<p>Creating a witch necessarily involves a powerful, malicious curse in your backstory. Who cast it? Did you take a curse upon yourself for power? Was your entire lineage cursed generations ago, leading to a bloodline of witches? Or did another spellcaster use sinister, forbidden magic to curse you for life? Decide on the nature of your witch's curse and think about how you relate to it now. Do you feel like the curse was secretly a blessing, or does the desire for vengeance burn in your heart?</p>
			<p class="indent">What negative effects does the curse leverage on your personality and mind? Are you haunted by spirits, or is your mind plagued by destructive thoughts? How do you feel, manipulating the power of this curse outwards, into hexes and spells?</p>
			<p class="indent">Work with your GM to determine how witches are perceived in the world. Are they feared, burned, and persecuted? Are you an openly-known witch? Do the other characters in your party know of your witchhood? Some witches keep the source of their magic a secret, or claim to be wizards or sorcerers to conceal the true darkness of their magic.</p>
			<h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
			<p>To build a witch quickly, make Charisma your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Then, choose the <i>chill touch</i> and <i>minor illusion</i> cantrips, and the spells <i>bane</i>, <i>hellish rebuke</i>, <i>hideous laughter</i>, and <i>thunderwave</i>. Lastly, choose the Hideous Witch's Curse, and the hexes Evil Eye and Misfortune.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You have learned to mold and reshape the magic that curses you into spells.</p>
			<h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
			<p>You know two cantrips of your choice from the witch spell list. You learn additional witch cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Witch table.</p>
			<h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
			<p>The Witch table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL OR HIGHER</h5>
			<p>You know four 1st-level spells of your choice from the witch spell list. The Spells Known column of the Witch table shows when you learn more witch spells of your choice.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the witch spells you know and replace it with another spell from the witch spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your witch spells. Your magic originates deep within yourself, where your insidious curse stirs restlessly. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a witch spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
			</center>
			<h5>RITUAL CASTING</h5>
			<p>You can cast any witch spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
			<p>You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your Witch spells.</p>
