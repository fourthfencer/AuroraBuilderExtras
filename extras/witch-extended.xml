			<p>Starting at 3rd level, you have learned a secret hex associated with the profane rites of long-forgotten covens. When you grasp a weapon in one hand, and nothing in your other hand, you can use your bonus action to spread your curse into its steel. You gain the following benefits until the end of your next turn:</p>
            <p class="indent">The weapon serves as an arcane focus.</p>
            <p class="indent">You add your Charisma modifier to AC, as long as you are not wearing medium or heavy armor or holding a shield.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use your Charisma modifier for the attack and damage rolls you make with a one-handed weapon.</p>
